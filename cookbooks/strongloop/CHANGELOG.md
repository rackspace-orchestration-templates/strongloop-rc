v1.0.0 (2014-08-18)
-------------------
* StrongLoop changed the default application name from `sls-sample-app` to
  `loopback-example-app`, updated the recipe accordingly. Added major version
  bump as this would break anyone using older versions of StrongLoop.
* Add ability for user to define [data
  source](http://apidocs.strongloop.com/loopback-datasource-juggler/#datasource-new-datasourcename-settings)
* Gems updated to use Berkshelf 3.1+
